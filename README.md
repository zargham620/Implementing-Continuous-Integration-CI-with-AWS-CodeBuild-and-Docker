# Implementing-Continuous-Integration-CI-with-AWS-CodeBuild-and-Docker
Implementing Continuous Integration (CI) with AWS CodeBuild and Docker
Implementing Continuous Integration (CI) with AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and Docker
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and Docker for a Node.js application. The pipeline automatically builds and deploys a containerized Node.js application to Amazon ECR.

Project Overview
The project sets up an automated CI/CD pipeline that:

Builds a Docker container for a Node.js application
Pushes the container to Amazon ECR
Implements continuous integration using AWS CodeBuild
Manages the pipeline with AWS CodePipeline
Prerequisites
AWS Account with appropriate permissions
Docker installed locally for testing
Node.js 14 or later
AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
Access to AWS ECR, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline services

Component Details
Node.js Application
A simple Node.js application that logs "docker huzaifa" to demonstrate the pipeline functionality.

Docker Configuration
The Dockerfile sets up a Node.js 14 environment and exposes port 8080:

Uses node:14 as base image
Sets up working directory in /var/src/app
Installs dependencies
Copies application code
Exposes port 8080
Runs the application
AWS CodeBuild Configuration
The buildspec.yml file defines the build process:

Pre-build phase: Logs into Amazon ECR
Build phase: Builds and tags Docker image
Post-build phase: Pushes images to ECR and creates deployment artifacts
Setup Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine

Configure AWS Services:

aws configure
Create an ECR repository:

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name zar_repo --region us-east-1
Update the buildspec.yml with your ECR repository URI

Set up AWS CodeBuild:

Create a new build project
Use the provided buildspec.yml
Configure appropriate IAM roles and permissions
Configure AWS CodePipeline:

Create a new pipeline
Connect to your source repository
Add CodeBuild as a build stage
Configure deployment stages as needed
Local Testing
Install dependencies:

npm install
Build Docker image locally:

docker build -t my-node-app .
Run the container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 my-node-app
Pipeline Workflow
Code changes are pushed to the repository
AWS CodePipeline detects changes and triggers the pipeline
CodeBuild builds the Docker image using buildspec.yml
The image is pushed to ECR
The application is ready for deployment
Security Considerations
Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are configured
Keep AWS credentials secure
Regularly update dependencies
Follow AWS security best practices
